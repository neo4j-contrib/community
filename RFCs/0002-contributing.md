## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations within the community. We all come from different backgrounds, which means we likely have different perspectives on technology and other topics. Assume good intent and try to listen to others rather than convince them that you are correct.
* The Neo4j Community has a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this community here or on any
other Neo4j channel, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Community

Meta discussions about the Neo4j Communtiy take place on [Discord](https://discorg.gg/neo4j) this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/community/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/community/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
