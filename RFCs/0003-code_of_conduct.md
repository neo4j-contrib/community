# RFC #0003 - Code of Conduct

> This is about the code of conduct, which appears at [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Why do we need a code of conduct?

> A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your project’s participants. 
> Adopting, and enforcing, a code of conduct can help create a positive social atmosphere for your community.
>
> -- [the Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#why-do-i-need-a-code-of-conduct)

## Establishing a code of conduct

> Try to establish a code of conduct as early as possible: ideally, when you first create your project.
>
> -- [the Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#establishing-a-code-of-conduct)

## Deciding how we'll enforce a code of conduct

> A code of conduct that isn’t (or can’t be) enforced is worse than no code of conduct at all: 
> it sends the message that the values in the code of conduct aren’t actually important or respected in your community.
>
> — Ada Initiative via [the Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#deciding-how-youll-enforce-your-code-of-conduct)

## Enfocing the code of conduct

> Sometimes, despite your best efforts, somebody will do something that violates this code. 
> There are several ways to address negative or harmful behavior when it comes up.
> 
> -- [the Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#enforcing-your-code-of-conduct)

## Community Responsibilities

> A code of conduct is not a law that is enforced arbitrarily. You are the enforcer of the code of 
> conduct and it’s your responsibility to follow the rules that the code of conduct establishes.
>
> -- [the Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#your-responsibilities-as-a-maintainer)

Responsibilties according to role:

- Observers have no responsibilities
- Participants abide by the code of conduct
- Contributors flag potential violations
- Advocates respond to flagged violations
- Team enforces suspensions, mutes, bans and similar remedial actions

## Encourage the behavior you want to see in the world

> When a project seems hostile or unwelcoming, even if it’s just one person whose behavior is tolerated by others, 
> you risk losing many more contributors, some of whom you may never even meet. It’s not always easy to adopt or 
> enforce a code of conduct, but fostering a welcoming environment will help your community grow.
