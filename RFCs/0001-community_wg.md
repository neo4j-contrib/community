# RFC #0001 - Neo4j Community Working Group

> A public collaboration focused on growing the community around graph technology.

*ACTION*: Should we try this approach to self-governance of the Neo4j Community?

## Community Roles: the Orbit Model

For roles and responsibilites within the community, it's helpful to recognize
different levels of engagement, as a function of both frequency and impact of 
some activity. The [Orbit Model](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model)

> The Orbit Model is a framework for building high gravity communities. A high gravity 
> community is one that excels at attracting and retaining members by providing an outstanding member experience.
>
> The Orbit Model contains four fundamental concepts: Gravity, Love, Reach and Orbit Level:
> 
> Love is a member's level of engagement and activity in the community.
> Reach is a measure of a community memberâ€™s sphere of influence.
> Gravity is the attractive force of a community that acts to retain existing members and attract new ones.
> Orbit levels are a practical tool for member segmentation and used to design different programs for each 
> level of the community.
