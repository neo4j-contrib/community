# Neo4j Community Working Group

> The Neo4j Community Working Group is a public collaboration focused on growing the community around graph technology.

Goals:

0. As a Community of People, creating personal and professional relationships
1. As a Community of Passion, advocating graph thinking as a transformative idea
2. As a Community of Practice, learning and sharing graph solutions to data challenges
3. As a Community of Product, contributing to the Neo4j ecosystem

Practically, the Working Group manages some resources and conducts programs. This repository is (will become) a management
tool for proposals, discussions, decisions and documentation. This is like an open-source project without code, founded by Neo4j 
and welcoming contributors. 

Principles:

- Transparency > Closed-doors
- Async > Sync
